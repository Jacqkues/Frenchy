This project is the implementation of an interpreted programming language using a "tree-walk" interpreter written in Rust.
The goal of the project is for me to learn Rust and understand how an interpreter works, as well as programming languages in general.
Currently, it has not a very good error handling but I am working on it for the next version which will be a VM version. Feel free to provide feedback on the code so that I can improve my Rust skills.
